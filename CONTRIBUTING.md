### How to add an API?
Using the FastAPI framework.
* Create a FastAPI Instance. 
    ```python
    router = FastAPI()
    ```
* Use Decorators to Define API Endpoints. For example:
    ```python
    @router.get("xxx")
    ```
* Implement the Route Handler Function.

* Add sub-routes to the main route  and tag the sub-routes in `backend/app/api/main.py` .
  ```python
  api_router.include_router(sub_router, tags=["xxxx"])  
  ```
